# Hi Salvin :)
This is where I think we should store all of the frontend componenets. I would suggest we have an index.html for the main page, and then if you need to do any styles or anything just move it into like a `styles/style.css` or something like that. Not sure if we'll need to use a lot of Js for this project, specifically typescript, so we may be good in that regard :)
